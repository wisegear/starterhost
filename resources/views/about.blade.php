            <div class="wise1text my-10">
                <p>For most of my life I have worked in Banking, I still do. But in the early 2000s I also built up and sold a web hosting business.  So I like to think I know a lot about the industry.</p>
                <p>In 2025 I am no longer involved in the Hosting industry at all but I still needed a place for my own sites, one a personal blog the other a Holocuast history site.</p>
                <p>It got me thinking, why not provide a place for other people who want to host a website, for free.  I needed the hosting anyway so the cost is my burden to bear. The cost is not 
                    that signficant anyway so it made sense and here is the site.</p>
                <p>The rules for our free hosting is really simple.</p>
                <ul class="">
                    <li class="">You must provide a domnain name and use the service to host a website</li>
                    <li class="">All websites must be in the English language</li>
                    <li class="">Legal content only</li>
                    <li class="">No mail spam</li>
                    <li class="">Idle accounts deleted after 30 days</li>
                    <li class="">1 account per member</li>
                    <li class="">Common sense prevails - You never said I couldnt store all my illegally downloaded movies on your server is not a defence</li>
                    <li class="text-orange-500 font-semibold">No users from China or India.  Sorry, you're just a nightmare for abuse</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you break a rule <b>we do not send any emails, ever,</b> your account is suspended. It is then up to you to log in and create a support ticket for more details. 
                    If you do not your account is deleted after 7 days.  Honestly, if it happens, you know why.</p>
                <p class="font-bold">Scripts run nightly looking for things that should'nt be there.</p>
