            The contact form I used got spammed so much that I removed it. For now, use the details below to get in touch. I am seeking a new way to control 
            spam and return the form. Visitors did use it a lot, but unfortunately, I kept missing genuine contact emails.</p>
        <p class="font-bold mb-2">I have created a new support system, just login to use it and get in touch.  I would prefer you use this rather than email. </p>
